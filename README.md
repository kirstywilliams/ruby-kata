# Ruby Kata

## Overview

Some kata completed for [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com). Hopefully sneak in one a day on my lunch break :).

## Kata
1. Factorial(n)
	
	Write a function that takes an integer 'n' and returns 'n!'.
2. vampire_test(a, b)

	Create a function that can receive two 'fangs' and determine if the product of the two is a valid vampire number.
3. digitise(n)

	Given a non-negative integer, return an array / a list of the individual digits in order.
4. findword(query, array_of_strings)

	Write a method that will search an array of strings for all strings that contain another string, ignoring capitalization. Then return an array of the found strings.
5. spread(func, args)

	Create a function, spread, that takes a function and a list of arguments to be applied to that function. You must make this function return the result of calling the given function/lambda with the given arguments.

6. head(arr), tail(arr), init(arr), last(arr)

	Haskell has some useful functions for dealing with lists:

	```$ ghci
	GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
	位 head [1,2,3,4,5]
	1
	位 tail [1,2,3,4,5]
	[2,3,4,5]
	位 init [1,2,3,4,5]
	[1,2,3,4]
	位 last [1,2,3,4,5]
	5```
	
	Implement these functions. Make sure it doesn't edit the array.

7. greet(name)
	
	Write a method that takes one argument as name and then greets that name, capitalized and ends with an exclamation point.

8. sumDigits(number)

	Write a function named sumDigits which takes a number as input and returns the sum of the absolute value of each of the number's decimal digits.
